# The Gilly Monster - Game Plan
## How the game works

#### Basic concept
The basic concept of the game is you are in a swamp, dark forest, or something similar, trying to avoid getting captured by the Gilly Monster.
The Gilly is a bush monster that is pretty much one of the most dangerous creatures in Wonder World.

#### Rules and gameplay
You and your opponents have to try and survive from the Gilly. The last man standing wins. Collect every item you see and build tools that give more opprotunities to get away from the Gilly.

The game will have a 15 minute timer, and every minute, the Gilly gets more hostile and stronger. If there are players still standing after the timer goes off, a score tally will take place.
Here is how the scores will be calculated:

- Time Ran From Gilly (10 seconds = 2pts)
- Tools Built (can range from 5pts to 300pts)
- Materials in Inventory (can range from 1pt to 80pts)
- Player Sacrifice (8pts x Number of Minutes passed)
